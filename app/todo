Priority:
---------

- when move to new clue, move to first empty square
- Error: "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable"
- fix screen before puzzle is uploaded
- highlight crossing clue in different color?

- Better CSS/layout (clues on right of grid, better fonts, etc.)
    - (still needs work)
    - automatically scale text in headline clue to not wrap
    - hide clue section if no puzzle
    - different color for solve puzzle prompt

- Timer

Longer Term:
------------

- Rebuses
- Show other players highlighted words
- zoom in bug (google chrome)


Completed:

- when holding down ctrl, don't enter letters
- options:
    - toggle options UI
    - option to strike/grey out filled in clues
    - option not to move to next entry when finish word
    - option to move instead of changing directions on arrow input
    - option to skip already filled squares
- Fix bug where people have different puzzles loaded (check puzzle against hash)
- add circled squares (from markdown in .puz)
- ENTER/shift-ENTER same as TAB/shift-TABs
