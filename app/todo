TODO
-----

- Fix bug where people have different puzzles loaded (check puzzle against hash)
- Check solution

Longer Term:
------------

- Better CSS/layout (clues on right of grid, better fonts, etc.)
- Rooms
- Rebuses (does .puz even have support for this?)
- Show other players highlighted words

completed:
- clicking on same cell toggles direction
- backspace should also move one back (and delete?)
- space should be disabled (maybe skip to next square?)
- tab should move to next clue
- clicking on clues should move to clues
